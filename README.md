# Discrimination-of-NIR-Spectra-of-different-bone-micro-structural-properties
In this project, I used Python to discriminate Near infrared spectra data into different classes based on their microstructural properties. 
The classification models were then evaluated against  gold standard result from MCT for validation. 
Overall, I showed that BVD had the best classification along the trabecular region.
